As mentioned im traveling this week so when I started the task I did not have access to the internet, that's why I opted to use a regular CSS file, I would have preferred to use styled-components. 

I also feel that I could have used just one component to add and update recipes so if I had more time I would definitely have done that.

The whole app was made using just what came in create react app, as instructed I did not use any component library for CSS, and I did not use any javascript liberys as I had no way to download them at the time. 

Best,
